# Assignment Project

## Project Overview
`Assignment Project` is a Godot project designed to extract and return the raw values (RGB struct) of a selected pixel. It then visualizes these values using a GLSL shader. The project is a blend of Godot's powerful game engine capabilities with advanced graphics programming, making it ideal for applications in image processing and visualization.
